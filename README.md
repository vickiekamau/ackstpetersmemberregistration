# Acks't Peter's Member Registration
ACKST PETERS MEMBERS REGISTRATION is a project solely dedicated to the ACK ST Peter's church Uthiru in Kenya, the church member registration is still manual which is tideaous to trace a member though thousands of files. Caroline Njeri, Vincent and Vickie Kamau saw it fit that we dedicate our skills to develop an application which will store data to the database through a API developed using Spring boot. We are certain that this application will solve the Member registration and Member search issue.
