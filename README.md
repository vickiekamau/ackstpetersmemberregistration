# Acks't Peter's Member Registration
ACKST PETERS MEMBERS REGISTRATION is a project solely dedicated to the ACK ST Peter's church Uthiru in Kenya, the church member registration is still manual which is tideaous to trace a member though thousands of files. Caroline Njeri, Vincent and Vickie Kamau saw it fit that we dedicate our skills to develop a an application which will store data to the database through an API. We are certain that this application will solve the Member registration and Member search issue.
